# Python-Projects.
A collection of basic Python projects, showcasing various concepts and techniques learned throughout the Python Developer course. They use various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3.

## Web Page Generator
The Web Page Generator is a simple Python app using Tkinter that allows users to create basic HTML pages. Users can generate a default page with a predefined message or input custom text to create a personalized web page, which opens in the default browser.

## Polymorphism Project
This Python project defines an Animal class with two child classes: Dog and Cat. It allows you to create instances of each animal and call their speak method, which prints a specific sound for each animal (e.g., "barks" for dogs and "meows" for cats). The project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and method overriding.

## Inheritance Project
This Python project demonstrates inheritance and method overriding with a class hierarchy. The People class serves as the parent class, with two child classes: Male and Female. Each class allows the creation of instances representing a person with specific attributes such as name, gender, job, and age. The project includes methods to describe the person and display detailed information about them.

## File Transfer Project
This Python Tkinter app allows users to select source and destination directories to transfer files. It only transfers files modified in the last 24 hours, skipping unchanged files, and replaces older files in the destination with newer ones.

## Encapsulation Project
This Python project demonstrates the use of private and protected attributes and methods within a Car class. The Car class contains private attributes (__make), protected attributes (_model, _year), and methods to start and stop the car. It shows how to define and restrict access to these elements while using public methods to interact with the class.

## Database Filter Project
This Python script connects to an SQLite database and creates a table to store file names. It filters a list of files to find .txt files, inserts their names into the database, and prints the list of qualifying files. The script uses SQLite to manage the database operations.

## Abstraction Project
This Python script demonstrates abstract classes with an Employee base class and subclasses (Manager, Developer, Designer). Each subclass implements the abstract role() method, while inheriting methods for job title, role, and department details.

## Django Checkbook Project
A Django-based digital checkbook project that allows users to manage finances by adding, updating, and deleting transactions. It provides a balance summary and tracks spending through a simple web interface. The project uses a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## Django University Project
A Django web application that allows users to manage university campuses and classes. Users can add, edit, or remove campus details (name, state, campus ID) and class information (name, number, professor) through the admin interface, accessible via /admin.

## Nice Or Mean Game
This Python game lets players interact with strangers by choosing to be nice or mean, affecting their score. Depending on their decisions, they can win or lose the game. The game also includes sound effects for winning and losing. Players can choose to play again while keeping track of their score and name.

## Project Phonebook
This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
